## Week 8 Monday drop-in session

Hi, everyone!

If you plan to go to the Monday drop-in session next week (Week 8), be aware that the venue is MVB 4.01 instead of the usual MVB 2.59. The time is the same (1 PM) and Andreea Catrina will gladly assist you during that session as usual.

Have a great week!

## Reading week Drop-in sessions

Hi, everyone!

It's finally reading week and I am coming up with a small surprise. The drop-in sessions are also holding this week. So, if you want to catch up with the material this week, this is the opportunity for you. 

Just one small observation, if you plan to go to the Monday drop-in session, be aware that the venue is MVB 4.01 instead of the usual MVB 2.59.

Be aware that problem classes and Q&A sessions do not take place during this week. But, Teams forum is still monitored.

Have a happy reading week and happy Halloween!

## Drop-in sessions announcement

Hi, everyone!

I have been reported that not many students attended last week's drop-in sessions. I would like to remind you that drop-In sessions run each day of the week starting from Week 2. 

While there was already an announcement about drop-ins times and locations, the webpage has only been updated this week with the drop-ins. We apologize for this.

So, if you have any questions about the unit, you can come in to one of the drop-ins where one of our brilliant TAs will be available to assist you with anything as long as it is about the unit material.

## Problem class date confusion + Re/Play issues

Hi everyone,

If you checked the unit page this week there were some dates for the next problem class like on Friday 14th of October, or on Monday 16th of October. These are incorrect dates. The actual date is 9th of October from 3pm to 4:20 pm and from 4:30 pm to 5:50 pm depending on the time you were allocated at the start of the year.

Furthermore, Re/Play issues with problem classes should be sorted from next week onwards. (The first class RE/Play just recorded the screen, not the whiteboard - IT services informed us it will now include the room camera as well.)

We apologize for this confusion. See you there  as many as possible!

## Drop-in session times, quiz extension

Hi all,

Drop-in sessions are now running every week, starting from tomorrow (the 4th) - or **today**, if you're checking your email at a sensible time! These are optional but useful chances to ask a TA questions one-on-one outside of problem classes and Q&As, and without having to wait for a response on Teams. I know some sessions will clash with some people's timetables, but every degree programme should have access to at least a few sessions.

**Monday 1pm-2pm:** MVB 2.59<br />
**Tuesday 1pm-2pm:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Wednesday 3pm-4pm:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Thursday 11am-noon:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Friday 4pm-5pm:** MVB 4.01

The quiz link for this week is also now fixed - to account for it going up late, I'm pushing the deadline back to **noon this Monday (the 9th)**. Sorry about that!

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - in previous years Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and hosting on GitHub helps us mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of noon this Friday (i.e. September 29th), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Monday. On the same day, week 2 will have its own material release, quiz, and Q&A to match a problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Friday September 29th**.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
