## COVID cases rising, policy reminder

Hi all,

Unfortunately, fresher's flu season has become more sinister in recent years, and like this time last year, we've started to get reports of students in this unit testing positive for COVID... I'm not planning to move problem classes online - when it comes to small-group teaching, in-person is drastically better, and a good mask cuts out almost all the risk the risk to you (see the first video for an overview). But I wanted to flag that there are active cases for the benefit of people who might otherwise choose not to wear a mask - while the COVID-positive students I know about are doing the right thing and staying home, normally for every two people who know they have COVID there's one person spreading it asymptomatically.

Speaking of which, if you have COVID yourself, please don't come to problem classes! While the classes are very useful, they're also optional. We don't take attendance, and they're going to be recorded and made available on Re/Play, so you can catch back up afterwards. You're also much more likely to get a worse case of COVID if you push yourself while you've got it - so not only is it better to keep other people safe, itâ€™s also in your own best interest to stay home and recover quickly rather than try to come in and end up recovering slowly.

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome and drop-in sessions

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! At this point you've hopefully already noticed that the main site is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - last year Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and this should help to mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of next Monday (i.e. October 3rd), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Friday. Meanwhile, Week 2 will have its own material release and Q&A to match a quiz deadline and problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Monday October 3rd**.

Also, it looks like we'll also be able to run daily drop-in sessions with TAs this term. The final time slots and locations will appear in your calendars soon, but the draft version is:

* **Mondays 11:45-12:45**:  In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Tuesdays 10:00-11:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Wednesdays 15:00-16:00**: Online on the unit team. Week 2 onwards.
* **Thursdays 14:00-15:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Fridays 13:00-14:00**: Online on the unit team. Week **\*1\*** onwards.

I know that not all of you will be able to make all these drop-in sessions, because free timetable slots are scarce, but I think we've managed to schedule things in such a way that most people have access to all of them and everyone has access to some of them.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
