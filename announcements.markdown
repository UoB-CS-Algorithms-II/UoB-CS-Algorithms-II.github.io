## Welcome and drop-in sessions

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! At this point you've hopefully already noticed that the main site is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - last year Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and this should help to mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of next Monday (i.e. October 3rd), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Friday. Meanwhile, Week 2 will have its own material release and Q&A to match a quiz deadline and problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Monday October 3rd**.

Also, it looks like we'll also be able to run daily drop-in sessions with TAs this term. The final time slots and locations will appear in your calendars soon, but the draft version is:

* **Mondays 11:45-12:45**:  In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Tuesdays 10:00-11:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Wednesdays 15:00-16:00**: Online on the unit team. Week 2 onwards.
* **Thursdays 14:00-15:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Fridays 13:00-14:00**: Online on the unit team. Week **\*1\*** onwards.

I know that not all of you will be able to make all these drop-in sessions, because free timetable slots are scarce, but I think we've managed to schedule things in such a way that most people have access to all of them and everyone has access to some of them.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
