# Announcements Page

## Welcome and drop-in sessions

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - in previous years Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and hosting on GitHub helps us mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of noon this Friday (i.e. September 29th), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Monday. On the same day, week 2 will have its own material release, quiz, and Q&A to match a problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Friday September 29th**.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
