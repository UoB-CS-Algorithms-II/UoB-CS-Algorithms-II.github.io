## Drop-in session times, quiz extension

Hi all,

Drop-in sessions are now running every week, starting from tomorrow (the 4th) - or **today**, if you're checking your email at a sensible time! These are optional but useful chances to ask a TA questions one-on-one outside of problem classes and Q&As, and without having to wait for a response on Teams. I know some sessions will clash with some people's timetables, but every degree programme should have access to at least a few sessions.

**Monday 1pm-2pm:** MVB 2.59<br />
**Tuesday 1pm-2pm:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Wednesday 3pm-4pm:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Thursday 11am-noon:** MVB 4.01<br />
**Friday 4pm-5pm:** MVB 4.01

The quiz link for this week is also now fixed - to account for it going up late, I'm pushing the deadline back to **noon this Monday (the 9th)**. Sorry about that!

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - in previous years Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and hosting on GitHub helps us mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of noon this Friday (i.e. September 29th), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Monday. On the same day, week 2 will have its own material release, quiz, and Q&A to match a problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Friday September 29th**.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
