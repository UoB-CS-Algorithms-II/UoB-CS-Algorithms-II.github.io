# Announcements Page

## Welcome!

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms and Data! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io). The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures yesterday evening, we'll have an in-person Q&A on Friday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of noon next Monday (i.e. September 23rd), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the same day. At the same time on the 23rd, week 2 will have its own material release, quiz, and Q&A to match a problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Monday September 23rd.**

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Friday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John

## Weekly Drop-Ins

Hi All,

As part of the unit we will be running 3 TA led drop-in sessions per week.
These will run similarly to drop-ins from other units, and are a chance for you to bring any work or questions you’d like to discuss.

The timings of these are as follows:
 - Tuesday 13:00
 - Wednesday 12:00
 - Thursday 13:00

The locations haven’t been confirmed yet, so for week 2 they will run online in the dedicated teams channel.
The locations will be updated once they have been confirmed.

## Re/Play recording issue

Hi all,

It looks like there was a recording issue with the first problem class - it captured the monitor rather than the whiteboard, so the recording is only of the audio. Thankfully I hedged my bets in terms of what would be captured and did the second class on the doc cam, which was captured fine! The two classes covered the same material, so even if you attended the first class you should probably still watch use the recording of the second class for reference, and in future I'll run classes with the doc cam.

(I know there can be issues seeing the doc cam at the back - if you're having trouble seeing please don't even put your hand up, just shout and ask me to zoom in/write bigger and I will!)

Best wishes,

John
