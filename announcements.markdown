## New problem class format from tomorrow!

Hi all,

From tomorrow onwards, we'll be experimenting with a **new format** for problem classes, which means **which group you're in might change** (although your time slot won't). So please read the rest of this email! 

Just about everyone finds this unit hard, but it became clear in the last class that different people find it hard in different ways. We’ve decided that going forward, we’ll split up the problem classes in each time slot according to these two areas people are struggling with most.

**Foundational class:** Run by **Adi** in **MVB 1.11** with an emphasis on helping with the definitions and algorithms themselves.

**Problem-based class:** Run by **John** in **MVB 1.11a** with an emphasis on using those definitions and algorithms to solve problems creatively.

As a general guide, if you find yourself having a lot of trouble with the \* and \*\* problems in a quiz in a given week, then you’ll probably get more out of Adi’s classes. These class will focus on questions like "what’s the difference between a path and a walk, or between isomorphism and equality, or between an induced subgraph and a subgraph?" "Is big O like less than or equals, or is it the other way round?" or "How would I implement Dijkstra’s algorithm?"

Other people find that the videos/quizzes/unit Team are enough to help them understand the definitions and algorithms introduced in the unit, but find it hard to see how to solve problems *using* these concepts. If that's you, then you'll probably get more out of my classes. These class will focus on questions like "How can you apply an exchange argument to a real greedy algorithm?" "How do you break a problem down into subproblems to apply induction or dynamic programming?" and "How would you come up with the proof of Dirac’s theorem for yourself?"

**This will replace your previous group assignments.** Whether you were originally assigned to my group or Adi's group for a given time slot, you can decide which class to go to on the day each week. This means that if you find the definitions or algorithms in a given week are unusually hard or unusually easy, then you can go to Adi’s class or my class accordingly. A TA will be standing outside with a whiteboard to point people to the right rooms. There won’t be anything examinable in either of our classes that’s not also covered in the lecture videos, so you don’t need to worry about missing out.

Also, one thing to ease people’s nerves a bit - while this is a very hard unit do well in, it’s not a very hard unit to pass. When I write the exam, I set up the mark distribution so that you can get a high 2.ii in this unit with just a solid grasp of the foundations. This means that if you understand the definitions and know the algorithms, then you have enough for a very comfortable pass. Getting a 2.i in the unit does require you to do some problem-solving as well, and this is genuinely difficult - normally about half the class manages it, and I have a lot of respect for everyone who does. But if you’re just worried about passing, then you can relax a little!

Best wishes,

John

## COVID cases rising, policy reminder

Hi all,

Unfortunately, fresher's flu season has become more sinister in recent years, and like this time last year, we've started to get reports of students in this unit testing positive for COVID... I'm not planning to move problem classes online - when it comes to small-group teaching, in-person is drastically better, and a good mask cuts out almost all the risk the risk to you (see the first video for an overview). But I wanted to flag that there are active cases for the benefit of people who might otherwise choose not to wear a mask - while the COVID-positive students I know about are doing the right thing and staying home, normally for every two people who know they have COVID there's one person spreading it asymptomatically.

Speaking of which, if you have COVID yourself, please don't come to problem classes! While the classes are very useful, they're also optional. We don't take attendance, and they're going to be recorded and made available on Re/Play, so you can catch back up afterwards. You're also much more likely to get a worse case of COVID if you push yourself while you've got it - so not only is it better to keep other people safe, it’s also in your own best interest to stay home and recover quickly rather than try to come in and end up recovering slowly.

Best wishes,

John

## Welcome and drop-in sessions

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms II! At this point you've hopefully already noticed that the main site is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io) - last year Blackboard gave us a lot of trouble with file permission issues, and this should help to mitigate them. The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures this morning, we'll have an online Q&A on Thursday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of next Monday (i.e. October 3rd), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the following Friday. Meanwhile, Week 2 will have its own material release and Q&A to match a quiz deadline and problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Monday October 3rd**.

Also, it looks like we'll also be able to run daily drop-in sessions with TAs this term. The final time slots and locations will appear in your calendars soon, but the draft version is:

* **Mondays 11:45-12:45**:  In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Tuesdays 10:00-11:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Wednesdays 15:00-16:00**: Online on the unit team. Week 2 onwards.
* **Thursdays 14:00-15:00**: In-person, room TBD. Week 2 onwards.
* **Fridays 13:00-14:00**: Online on the unit team. Week **\*1\*** onwards.

I know that not all of you will be able to make all these drop-in sessions, because free timetable slots are scarce, but I think we've managed to schedule things in such a way that most people have access to all of them and everyone has access to some of them.

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Thursday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John
