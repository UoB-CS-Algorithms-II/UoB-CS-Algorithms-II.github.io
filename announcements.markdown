# Announcements Page

## Welcome!

Hi all,

Welcome to Algorithms and Data! Our main unit page is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](http://uob-cs-algorithms-ii.github.io). The first video gives a much more detailed introduction, but in short, this unit will cover material on a rolling basis. For example, for Week 1, I released video lectures yesterday evening, we'll have an in-person Q&A on Friday, there's a Blackboard quiz on the material with a deadline of noon next Monday (i.e. September 23rd), then we'll have a 90-minute in-person problem class on it the same day. At the same time on the 23rd, week 2 will have its own material release, quiz, and Q&A to match a problem class in Week 3, and so on. 

**These weekly quizzes do count towards your unit mark, and are essentially free marks - don't let them slip by!** Again, the first quiz deadline is **noon on Monday September 23rd.**

I hope you all enjoy the unit - see you on Friday for the first Q&A!

Best wishes,

John

## Weekly Drop-Ins

Hi All,

As part of the unit we will be running 3 TA led drop-in sessions per week.
These will run similarly to drop-ins from other units, and are a chance for you to bring any work or questions you’d like to discuss.

The timings of these are as follows:
 - Tuesday 13:00
 - Wednesday 12:00
 - Thursday 13:00

The locations haven’t been confirmed yet, so for week 2 they will run online in the dedicated teams channel.
The locations will be updated once they have been confirmed.

Adi
